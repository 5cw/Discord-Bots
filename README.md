# Discord-Bots
### Here be two discord bots I wrote, currency_bot and knuc_tats_bot, that are free and open source, I think by default, I don't have any idea how liscences work. Used for the People's Improv Group Discord Server at the University of Vermont.

* [Currency Bot Documentation](currency_bot/CURRENCY_BOT_README.md)

* [Knuc Tats Bot Documentation](knuc_tats_bot/KNUC_TATS_BOT_README.md)

I'm hosting them on [heroku](https://heroku.com), which you [can do for free, but it's a bit of a pain.](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/how-to-host-a-discord-py-bot-on-heroku-and-github-d54a4d62a99e)

You'll need to create an accompanying [discord bot](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) for each of them.

Look at [runner.py](runner.py) if you're trying to run two discord bots from the same server (if, for instance, you're trying to not spend money.)
